2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock vta_i/pll_clk/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin vta_i/pll_clk/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock vta_i/pll_clk/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>
